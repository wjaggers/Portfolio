        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm William Jaggers! I used to work for an outstanding company called Travelport, where we supplied software to manage travel content and provide search and booking capabilities to traditional travel agencies, online travel agencies, consolidators, and more.  Unfortunately, the company decided to move to a managed software services provider and to close our Kansas City office.</p>
        <p>While I was made an offer to relocate to the Denver office, my circumstances at present made that impractical.  So I am taking this opportunity to look for work in a different sector of information technology.  I find web development to be very interesting and exciting, and look forward to using my skills and experience to bring new value to the ever-changing environment of the world wide web!</p>
