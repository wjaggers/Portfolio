    	<p>This was the first original project that I coded.  I wanted to get some Javascript under my belt, and experiment with various aspects of the language.  I was able to practice markup and styling, as well as DOM manipulation using Javascript.  I also got to work with some number and string functions, as well as a couple of different event handlers.  It isn't super sophisticated, but it's fun to play around with.</p>
