    	<p>While looking for ideas for my portfolio, I came across a suggestion to "make a website for your favorite taco place".  I liked the idea, so I looked up my favorite mexican restaurant, and found that they already had a web site.  But I noticed that it had some problems and was very simply styled.  So I decided to try and improve it.  The main problems were some glitchy image transitions in the menu page that distorted the images, frequent errors when clicking menu categories, and an overall lack of styling, including some curious image choices on the home page.  The locations map also had some incorrect information displayed when clicking on location markers.  When I re-did the site, I first made it responsive using Bootstrap.  Then I used JSON data for all of the location and menu information (including prices!), so that it could be updated as more restaurants were added or the menu changed.  I styled the text and replaced the main page image.  I also swapped the "coupons" tab for one that could highlight their catering service, although I had no real information to include in this page.  I tried to remain true to the overall look and feel of the site while giving it a face lift.</p>
    	<p>I have included links to both versions of the site for comparison - the current active web site, and my re-worked version.  Check them out in the links below!</p>
