    <div class="intro">
    	<p>The original source for this game came from a book I was studdying - Head First Javascript.  I liked the example because it utilized the Model/View/Controller method, and introduced event-driven programming.  But the original game was very simple - ship locations were (Math.) randomly chosen, it was for a single player, and for some reason it was unnecessarily large, requiring scrolling on most displays.  I made modifications to first resize the game, and then to make it into a two-player game with the ability to select ship locations manually.  I then improved the message and input areas, and added logic to control the game play for two players.  I got experience hiding and showing various messages and buttons, and manipulating properties and values in objects.</p>
    	<p>I have included both versions for comparison - the original from the book, and my enhanced version.  Check them out in the links below!</p>
